Frontiers is a fully on-chain PvP kingdom-building RTS game
Developed with Unreal engine 5 during the OPOS hackathon.

Players can choose between 3 factions.; Orcs, Lizards, & Fishmen.
Players must collect resources and build their kingdom to prepare for war.

Placing structures unlocks new kingdom upgrade systems and enables PvP when placing a PvP portal structure.
Once a player has placed a lumbermill, quarry, blacksmith, barracks, and carpenter hut they can begin building walls & defenses to protect their Throne Hall.

The on-chain OPOS alpha release caps players at level 10 giving them the ability to experience the on-chain mechanics and tutorial/beginning phase of the game.
